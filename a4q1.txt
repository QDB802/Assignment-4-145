a)
The Function Definition begins on line 25.
It has a void return-type (i.e. None)
A function named fizzbuzz.
And a parameter, "n" with an int type (This is considered 1 parameter, not 2.)
This is much different from python, with significant differences in formatting function definitions:

C: return_type function_name(parameter-list) -> void fizzbuzz(int n)
Python: def function(parameters):
            ...
            return return_value
return statements can be a data_type such as int, str, etc. It is not specified in the function definition like in C.

b)
The function call occurs on line 47 with the call:
fizzbuzz(input);
This is semi-identical to pythons function call except for the use of the semicolon on C
C: function(parameters);
Python: function(parameters)
