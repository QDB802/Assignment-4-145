a)
The Function Definition begins on line 25.
It has a void return-type (i.e. None)
A function named fizzbuzz.
And a parameter, "n" with an int type (This is considered 1 parameter, not 2.)
This is much different from python, with significant differences in formatting function definitions:

C: return_type function_name(parameter-list) -> void fizzbuzz(int n)
Python: def function(parameters):
            ...
            return return_value
return statements can be a data_type such as int, str, etc. It is not specified in the function definition like in C.

b)
The function call occurs on line 47 with the call:
fizzbuzz(input);
This is semi-identical to pythons function call except for the use of the semicolon on C
C: function(parameters);
Python: function(parameters)

c)
The variable used in the program is "i". It is used in the loop.
Input is also used as a variable, as it's updated once the inputs a number, then used in the main fizzbuzz program.
The parameter used in the program is "n". it is used in the fizzbuzz program to determine the amount of times the loop
should cycle through.
The argument used in the program is also input. It is run in the fizzbuzz program.
